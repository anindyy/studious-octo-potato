    Hello, this is <b>Anindya</b>, <br/> <br/>
    an informatics student who is willing to eat ice cream as breakfast,
    lunch, and dinner every single day if they were healthy enough. <br> <br>
    <i>(just kidding, I'll probably get sick of them on the third day)</i> <br> <br>
    Not really fond of talking but I love making friends. 100% awkward. <br> <br>

    <i>Do you want to get awkward together?</i>
